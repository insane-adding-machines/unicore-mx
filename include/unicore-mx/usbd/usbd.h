/**
 * Unlike the old stack in which application code had to handle packet level
 * details, the new stack design will let application request a transfer
 * in a abstract design without having to deal with packet level details.
 *
 * In the new design, the application code need to initalize the device object
 *  using usbd_init() (like the old stack).
 *
 * Application can register SET_CONFIGURATION and SET_INTERFACE callback.
 *
 * On SET_CONFIGURATION,
 *  application code need to pass on the requirement of memory different endpoints.
 *  because different hardware have different design which the stack abstract out.
 *  for example, some hardware have FIFO (dynamically) OR
 *  packet area that need to be divided among endpoints.
 *  one such feature is DOUBLE_BUFFER.
 *
 *  DOUBLE_BUFFER allow stack to make better use of hardware.
 *  the periph can send one buffer while the stack prepare the second buffer.
 *  and when done, switches the buffer.
 *
 *  usbd_ep_prepare(dev, ep, size, flag)
 *    ep = endpoint number (7bit = dir)
 *    size = maximum endpoint size
 *    flag = {DOUBLE_BUFFER}
 *  if the flag is not supported, it is simply ignored.
 *  (as in case of st fs dev) double buffering eat up 2 endpoint
 *  so, if you are using double buffer, do not setup the reverse direction endpoint.
 *
 *
 * On SET_INTERFACE,
 *    dtog need to be cleared for the endpoint inside the interface.
 *
 * Application code need to pass the endpoint size,type via transfer so that
 *  stack do not have to lookup (require computation) or cache (require memory)
 *  for the endpoint. also, application code can easily manintain the values.
 *
 * for application code, it can fill up the transfer object and submit it.
 * When the transfer is done, a callback is done (if requested)
 *
 * In transfer, endpoint_type=Control are a bit special.
 *  (application code will rarely have to deal with them, dont worry - ignore)
 * in order to receive SETUP packet, need to register callback for that.
 *  atm the callback is used for ep0 only and the specific api isnt public.
 *  in future, if someone come up with a usecase, we can think over it better and make it public
 *
 * when a SETUP packet callback is done, code need to handle the setup and do a
 *  IN/OUT transfer for data stage. or do the status stage.
 *
 * a special exception is, in order to stall the control transaction,
 *  only the callback shall be used for stalling.
 * also, stall on control endpoint are automatically cleared after sending to host.
 *
 * because double buffer is very different for different backends.
 *
 * Some tips:
 *  - Dont not call the api with more than endpoint supported by backend.
 *  - flags are backend/implementation specific and may be ignored.
 *  - SET/CLEAR stall does not necessarily result in Data toggle bit to be reset.
 *     this is very specifically dependent on the peripherial
 *  - when a STALL is set, all transfer all paused till the STALL is not cleared
 *    also, STALL override the NAK status
